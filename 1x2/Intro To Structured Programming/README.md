# intro-to-structured-programming

For this class we had two types of homeworks. 
  1) Labs: We had 4 labs with the total weight of %20. We were asked to solve a problem ,which was usually about something they covered in the class that week, in around 2 hours. 
  2) Semester Project: We had a single semester project with the weight of %20. This one was about searching and documenting an existing algorithm. I picked flood fill algorithm. Wrote the code, but this project wasn't mainly about coding as the 
codes were available online . It was more about learning a new algorithm,  analysing an algorithm complexity , finding fields where the algorithm was used, documenting the algorithm, 
and then taking a video where we explained the algorithm to improve our presenting skills as well.
