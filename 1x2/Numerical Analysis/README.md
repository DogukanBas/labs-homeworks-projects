This is my semester project for the numerical analysis class.
I have implemented the methods down below in C :
1. Bisection method
2. Regula-Falsi method
3. Newton-Raphson method
4. Inverse Matrix
5. Gauss elimination
6. Gauss Seidal method
7. Numerical differentiation(center forward and backward difference )
8.  Simpson method (both 1/3 and 3/8)
9. Trapezoidal method
10. Gregory Newton interpolation for a constant h
