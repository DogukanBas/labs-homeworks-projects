We had 3 types of homeworks for this particular class.

1) Labs : We had 3 labs with total weight of %15, we usually had a short time to submit the labs such as 2-3 hours. 

2) Homeworks: We had 3 homeworks with total weight of %15 , unlike the labs we usually had 3-4 days to submit the homeworks and they were harder than the labs.

3) Semester project: We had a single semester project with total weight of %10.


#Semester Project:

In the semester project we were asked to code the memory card game that we all played when we were a kid. It is a game where we have a N x N grid full of cards
and each card has a pair, we are suppossed to find the pairs. We are playing against the computer. There is 3 levels, easy-medium-hard. The computer remembers up to 16 cards
in the hard mode. and it only remembers 2 cards in the easy mode. The simplest way to explain the computer's algorithm would be ; if there is 2 pairs in the memory pick them
otherwise make a random choice. 
Though I have implemeneted lots of small nuences to the computer's choice algorithm and it makes it quite hard to win against computer even in the medium mode.
